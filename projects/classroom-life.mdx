  # Classroom Life

  ## Overview

  Winner of the Agent Olympics Hackathon 2026 "Best use of ElevenLabs" Challenge - Classroom Life is an AI-powered tutoring simulation featuring a 3D classroom environment where an AI tutor interacts with simulated students. The system diagnoses each student's understanding level (1-5) through strategic conversation, then adapts its teaching approach accordingly. ElevenLabs brings the characters to life with unique voices for each student personality and enables voice-based tutor input. Classroom Life was created by Team Mr. Karpathy consisting of Di Wu, Jae Yoon Bae, Emanuel Morhard, Syed Wassi Ul Haque and Elhassan Ould El Moustapha

  ## Key Features

  - **Adaptive AI Tutoring**: 10-turn conversations with diagnostic phase (turns 1-5) followed by personalized tutoring (turns 6-10)
  - **LLM-Based Understanding Assessment**: GPT-4o evaluates student responses to predict mastery level using educational rubrics
  - **Immersive Voice Experience**: Each student has a unique ElevenLabs voice matching their personality (shy, confident, anxious, etc.)
  - **Voice Input for Tutors**: Speak your tutoring responses using ElevenLabs speech-to-text
  - **3D Classroom Visualization**: Interactive React Three Fiber scene with speech bubbles synced to audio playback
  - **Educational Image Generation**: AI-generated visual aids displayed on the classroom monitor

  ## How It Works

  1. **Student Simulation**: GPT-4o-mini powers simulated students with distinct personalities (easily distracted, perfectionist, unmotivated, overconfident, shy)
  2. **Diagnostic Phase**: The tutor asks strategic questions to gauge understanding without teaching
  3. **Level Prediction**: After 5 turns, an LLM judge evaluates all student responses against educational rubrics to predict their level (1-5)
  4. **Tutoring Phase**: The AI adapts explanations, examples, and practice problems to the diagnosed level
  5. **Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs TTS with per-character voice settings (stability, similarity boost) creates distinct personalities
  6. **Real-time Animation**: Speech bubbles reveal text word-by-word synchronized with audio duration

  ## Technologies Used

  - **ElevenLabs API**:
    - Text-to-Speech (`eleven_multilingual_v2`) with 6 distinct voice configurations
    - Speech-to-Text (`scribe_v2`) for voice input transcription
  - **OpenAI**: GPT-4o-mini for student simulation, tutor responses, and level prediction; gpt-image-1-mini for educational illustrations
  - **React Three Fiber**: 3D classroom rendering with Three.js
  - **React + TypeScript + Vite**: Frontend framework
  - **Express.js**: Backend API server
  - **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Styling

  ## Getting Started

  ```bash
  # Clone and install
  cd frontend/classroom-life-main
  npm install

  # Configure environment
  cp .env.example .env
  # Add your API keys:
  # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  # ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
  # Add Vite API URL:
  # VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001

  # Run in frontend/classroom-life-main
  npm run dev

  Open http://localhost:8080, select a student and topic, then start tutoring!
